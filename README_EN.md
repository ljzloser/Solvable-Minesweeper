## Introduction

**Meta Minesweeper** is developed by experienced professional Minesweeper players and software engineers. It is not a simple clone of traditional Minesweeper, but a complete modernization in **algorithms, performance, extensibility, and tooling**.

Its replay formats are officially recognized by the [Open Minesweeper Network](https://openms.top) and included in international leaderboards.

## Key Advantages & Technical Highlights

### (1) Algorithm & Engine System

Powered by the `ms_toollib` toolbox, Meta Minesweeper’s core strength comes from its highly optimized algorithm components that form a complete intelligent Minesweeper system.

* **Three inference engines**: multi-layered solving strategies from set-based deduction to full enumeration.
* **Unified board state machine**: abstracts the game board into a formal automaton, improving algorithm composability and extensibility.
* **Probability inference engine**: computes the probability of any tile containing a mine, with speed second only to JSMinesweeper.
* **Optical Board Recognition (OBR)**: reconstructs board states from screenshots of *any* Minesweeper application for cross-software intelligent analysis.

---

### (2) Architecture & Tech Stack

Designed for strong performance, safety, and tooling friendliness.

* **Python / PyQt5 + Rust hybrid architecture**

  * Python handles UI and ecosystem extensions.
  * Rust provides high-performance, memory-safe core computation.
* **Complete UI–algorithm separation**, enabling independent iteration.
* Fully open-source toolbox **`ms_toollib` (MIT License)**, installable via `pip install ms_toollib` for use in external projects.

---

### (3) Gameplay Modes & Interaction

One of the most feature-complete and modernized Minesweeper implementations available.

* Supports **all 6 guess-free modes + Standard + Win7 mode**; weak/strong semi-guessable modes are unique implementations.
* **Ctrl + mouse wheel**: freely scale UI size.
* **Space**: compute mine probability for every tile.
* **Ctrl + Space**: screenshot + OBR to compute probabilities for external Minesweeper applications.
* **Board filter**: complex filtering based on custom strategies.
* **Performance metrics**: built-in 3BV/s, STNB, RQP, and custom formulas.

---

### (4) Replay System & Ecosystem Compatibility

Meta Minesweeper is not just a game but a full analysis platform.

* Advanced replay player with high-level analysis and real-time probabilities.
* Supports **avf / rmv / mvf / [evf](https://github.com/eee555/ms_toollib/blob/main/evf标准.md)** formats.
* Supports **[evfs](https://github.com/eee555/ms_toollib/blob/main/evfs标准.md)** replay-set format.
* Resistant to common cheating methods (e.g., speed-gear tools).
* Internationalization: Chinese, English, German, Polish, etc.

Meta Minesweeper is actively developed and typically releases **every 3–12 months**.
Issues, PRs, stars, and forks are all welcome.

## Installation

Supported OS: **Windows 10 / Windows 11 only**

### Option 1: Install via Official Download (Recommended)

Find the latest version in the [download section](#下载链接), unzip it, and run `main.exe` directly (click “Run anyway” if prompted).
Software installed this way is the **official, fully signed version**, capable of generating valid replay signatures (`metaminesweeper_checksum.pyd` is the small closed-source signing module).

### Option 2: Install via GitHub Actions (Safest)

**Note:** this version **cannot** generate valid replay signatures. Replays created by self-built versions cannot pass validation by the official build. All other features are identical.

Go to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/eee555/Solvable-Minesweeper/actions), find the latest successful build, download the Artifacts, and run as above.
Provides the newest features and guaranteed clean/no-virus builds, but unreleased builds may be unstable.

### Option 3: Build from Source (Not Recommended)

**Note:** this version also **cannot** produce valid replay signatures.
Users may create custom builds and implement their own secret signature logic if desired.

Requirements:

* Python ≥3.10, ≤3.12 (3.12 recommended)
* Ability to use PowerShell or any CLI

Steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/eee555/Solvable-Minesweeper.git
```

Option A: Install Python deps from PyPI (simple, may fail if API changed)

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt   # Windows
pip3 install -r requirements.txt  # *nix
```

Option B: Install deps from GitHub (nightly ms_toollib; guaranteed to work; requires Rust)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/eee555/ms_toollib.git
cd ms_toollib/python_package
cargo build --release
# Rename ms_toollib.dll → ms_toollib.pyd and copy to Solvable-Minesweeper/src
# Install all remaining requirements except ms_toollib
```

Additional required files (copy from any earlier release):

* `en_US.qm`, `de_DE.qm`, `pl_PL.qm` etc. → Solvable-Minesweeper/
* `params.onnx` model → Solvable-Minesweeper/src/

Run:

```sh
py -3 src/main.py     # Windows
python3 src/main.py   # *nix
```
